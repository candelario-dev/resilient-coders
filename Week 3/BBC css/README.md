## How It's Made:
### Tech used: HTML, CSS

A recreation of BBC.com's website from a day in 2017. It uses a combination of HTML and CSS to recreate it. It has three media queries declared to make it responsive to three breaking points. It uses content decisions to decide what's important to keep and what's less important for a pleasant user experience in different screen sizes.


## What I Learned:
I learned how to make content decisions and utilize media queries in CSS to better optimize user experience for my next projects.
