# Week 3 of Resilient Coders Bootcamp
Week #3 of the resilientcoders.org bootcamp as part of the 2020b cohort.

## What I Learned
This week we learned about media queries, responsiveness and content-decisions in CSS.

We made different projects that helped us work on making projects responsive to different screen sizes, and we learned how to make content decisions to optimize user experience.

* BBC: A responsive recreation of the BBC's front page.
* JWLI: A responsive recreation of JWLI's front page.
* Tech Crunch: A responsive recreation of Tech Crunch's front page.
