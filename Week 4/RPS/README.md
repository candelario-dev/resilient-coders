## How It's Made:
### Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a simulator for the most universal game in history: Rock, Paper or Scissors. As everyone knows **rock** beats **scissors**, **scissors** beats **paper** and **paper** beats **rock** in a vicious, never ending cycle. In this game, you play against a bot who challenged you to a game. Choose your weapon wisely, and press the button that has your weapon of choice. The bot will also choose a weapon, and if the bot wins, a point will be added to his score. If you win, a point will be added to your score.

The languages used here are HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The randomization for the bot's weapon is made by using Math.random() and assigning a value to each weapon. Then, once the program received the weapon of your choice (picked by pressing the according button), it compares both choices, and declares a winner, adding a point to the score of whoever won, or stating a tie if need be.


## What I Learned:
This project was one of my first introductions to JavaScript. I learned how to do a randomization utilizing Math.random(), how to write functions, how to hook up buttons and make the work with the code, and how to manipulate the DOM.
