## How It's Made:
### Tech used: JavaScript
Program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), it prints "Buzz" instead. Then, the program has a modification where it prints "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5, while still printing "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those.

## What I Learned:
I learned how to use loops and conditionals, how to stop loops, and how to use the % (modulus) in JavaScript.
