## How It's Made:
### Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Calculator-Bot 3000 is a robot themed calculator where the user can input two numbers into its eyes, and by pressing an operator symbol on its mustache, you get the result of the mathematical operation assiged to that symbol in its mouth.

Each button is hooked up to a function true to its symbol. The **+** button calls a function where it takes the user's inputted numbers and adds them together, spitting out the sum of both numbers. The **-** symbol calls a function where it takes the user's inputted numbers and subtracts them, spitting out the difference of both numbers. The **x** symbol calls a function where it takes the user's inputted numbers and multiplies them, spitting out the product of both numbers. Lastly, the **/** symbol calls a function where it takes the user's inputted numbers and divides them together, spitting out the quotient of both numbers.

## What I Learned:
This project was one of my first tries at JavaScript and utilizing functions to perform mathematical equations, and one of my first experiences successfully receiving data the user inputs and manipulating the DOM.
