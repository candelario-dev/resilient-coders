# Week 4 of Resilient Coders Bootcamp
Week #4 of the resilientcoders.org bootcamp as part of the 2020b cohort.

## What I Learned
This week was our introduction to our first real programming language: JavaScript.

We used different things such as loops, conditionals, functions, etc., combined with HTML and CSS to create full stack applications that are both responsive and run as wished.
