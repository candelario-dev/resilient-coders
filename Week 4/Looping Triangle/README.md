## How It's Made:
### Tech used: JavaScript
Program that uses a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output a triangle of octothorpes stopping when the length hits 7 octothorpes.

## What I Learned:
I learned how to use loops and conditionals, how to stop loops, and how to use the ".length" in JavaScript.
