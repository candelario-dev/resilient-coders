## How It's Made:
### Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Horoscope app that when the user inputs their birthday in the fields, it uses that input and runs it through a series of loops and conditionals in its JavaScript to let you know which is your zodiac sign and what Avatar: The Last Aibender character you'd be according to your sign.

There's also a few easter eggs included for fans of the show.

###### DISCLAIMER: I am not an astrologist. These descriptions and character decisions assigned to each sign are to be taken lightly, as they are probably too vague and/or not accurate at all.  

## What I Learned:
Making this project I learned about how to use loops and conditionals to manipulate the DOM, how the order of things inside a function can alter how it'll run, and how to make images and text appear in the DOM.
