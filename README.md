## How It's Made
###### Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
This is a compilation of projects and practice-code utilized in my time in the resilientcoders.org bootcamp as a part of the 2020b cohort. The most used languages to do these projects are HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.

You're welcome to take a look!

## What I learned
Resilient Coders was my first introduction to the world of coding, and I couldn't be more satisfied with my progress in this field. I feel like I've made very good progress and have advanced a lot since I started. I went from never having touched a single line of code to making full-stack web applications in a matter of months!
