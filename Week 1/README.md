# Week 1 of Resilient Coders Bootcamp
Week #1 of the resilientcoders.org bootcamp as part of the 2020b cohort.

## What I Learned
This week we learned how to code using HTML.

We took different screenshots of some newspaper websites and made an HTML file containing the code we think was used to make it.

## Content
This week contains the following projects:
* BBC Classwork: A markup recreation of the BBC's front page.
* Brownies: A markup recreation of a recipe website.
* TC Classwork: A markup recreation of Tech Crunch's website's front page.
